<h4>Game next week: Thursday</h4>

<h4>Questions (Tues)</h4>

<h5> struct</h5>
<ul> 
  <li> What are the advangtages of O-O classes over structs? [poll or jamboard or whiteboard]</li>
  <li> How to think about the syntax for struct
    <pre>
      type var1;
      type var1, var2, var3;
      type var1=val1, var2=val2;
      struct s-name {fields} var1;
    </pre>

  </li>
</ul>

<h5> Memory: Heap vs stack, etc</h5>
<ul>
  <li> What is the real difference between the heap and the stack?</li>
  <li> When we talk about memory locations, does that include registers? see figure on memory hierarchy</li>
  <li> Is the heap like a junk drawer? Do values on the heap last a long or short time? are they accessed frequently or rarely?</li>
  <li> When would you use malloc/free instead of array[SIZE]? [poll: array shared, you know the size at compile time, local]</li>
  <li> Can you use pointers without using malloc?</li>
  <li> Do most C programs use malloc()?</li>
  <li> Why are globals bad? besides storage</li>
  <li> Where can I learn more about stack and heap? I assume that you understand the figure in Chapter 2. OSTEP book Arpaci-Dusseau</li>
</ul>

<h5> Pointers and arrays</h5>
<ul>
  <li> What is a linked list? What is ArrayList in Java?</li>
  <li> Making pointers or any variable global is always risky. Using aliases is also risky.
    Classes (O-O) are the best solution to this. Instance variables are shared by methods and don't need to be passed as parameters,
    but other classes cannot access them except through getters and setters.
    <li> Why do you need to specify the number of columns for a 2D array?
      <pre>
        int arr[20][100];
        arr is the base address of array arr
        what is the adderss of arr[2][15], given the base address arr?
      </pre>

    </li>
    <li> Why isn't there a function to tell you the size of an array i C?</li>
    <li> Are all variables really pointers anyway?</li>
    <li> When you pass an
      array into a function, any manipulation to the array within the function changes the array in the
      larger scope because it's actually the address of array[0] that gets passed in? In other words, it's
      not a copy that gets passed in?  YES
      </li>
      <li> What is sizeof(int *)</li>
      <li> looking at pointers and memory
        <pre>
          |          |    --->  |           |
        </pre>
        Which is the location of p? Which is the location of *p?
      </li>
      <li> Why are pointers so important? Almost every C program uses them.</li> 
</ul>

<h4>Thursday</h4>

<h5>Other C stuff</h5>
  <ul>
    <li> what is the scope of a variable? That can be different from the life of the variable.</li>

    <li> What is the difference between an argument and a [formal] parameter?
    <pre>
      int add(int x, int y){return x + y;}
      int main(){
        int a = 5;
        int b = 7;
        int z = add(a, b);
    </pre> [poll]
    </li>
    <li> Next year is an OS and Networking year</li>
    <li> circuits: any circuit can be constructed with AND, OR, NOT</li>
    <LI> can any circuit be constructed with NAND?</LI>
    <li> Can any circuit be constructed with XOR? [poll]</li>
    <li> Using &amp; in front of a variable is useful whenever you want something to point to it.</li>
    <li> The <code>restrict</code> keyword can be used with pointers
    <pre>
      void fun(int* restrict p) { }
    </pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conway's Game of Life (2D arrays)</h4>
See Wikipedia article
<ul>
  <li> This is an example of a cellular automaton. It composed of a grid of cells. Each cell has a binary state and
    gets input from its immediate neighbors. Based on that, it can change its state according to fixed rules
  </li>
  <li> The board is an NxM grid, i.e. a 2D array, fixed size. not quite global. Maybe <code>static</code>.  </li>
  <li> A value of 1 means that the cell is alive</li>
  <li> The update rules are described in the Wikipedia article
    <pre>
      Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
      Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
      All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li> For lab: You can first implement it in either Java or C [or both].</li>
</ul>

<h4>Debugging with gdb</h4>
<ul>
    <li> What can you do when your program crashes (segmentation fault)?</li>
    <li> Java gives you a stack trace so you can see where the problem might be.</li>
    <li> Our first goal is to use gdb to figure out where a program crashed.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Program structure</h4>
You should have a programming environment to work in, e.g. gitpod. Note that gitpod has its own copy of the files from github
<ul>
  <li> git add, commit, push</li>
  <li> Scope of variables: local or global
    <pre>
      int a;
      int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
      }
      
      int main() {
        int c;
      
      }
    </pre>
    variables a, b, c, x, y
  </li>
 <li> see fig 1 in 2.1</li>
 <h4> Pointers</h4>
 <ul>
  <li> pointers are addresses</li>
  <li> 
    <pre>
      int *px;  //px is n address. The value at that address is an int
      int *array;  //array is the address of an array of ints
      int x = 8;
      px = &amp;xi;
      *px = 5; // what happens?
    </pre>
  </li> 
  <li> NULL pointer
    <pre>
      px = NULL;
      *px = 5;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li> pointers can be used to pass array parameters
    <pre>
      int array[] = {1,2,3,4,5};

      void fun(int *p) {
        p[0] = 12;
        return;
      }

      fun(array);
    </pre>
  </li>
  
</ul>

<!---->
<h4>Dynamic memory allocation</h4>
<ul>
  <li> What are some reasons?</li>
  <li> dynamic arrays [programming break]
    <pre>
      int *array = (int *) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
      if (array != NULL) {
        array[9] = 42;
      }
      // does C initialize the array to 0?
      free(array);
      array = NULL;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li> memory management in C is a potential problem  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Arrays and strings</h4>
<ol>
  <li> syntax slightly different from java</li>
  <li> example
    <pre>
      int ar[10];
      int ar = {1,2,3,4};
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li> Strings are arrays of char, 
    <pre>
      char str1[10];
      char *str2 = "hello";
    </pre>  
  </li>
  <li> what happens if you use [programming break]
    <pre>
      sizeof(*str2);
      sizeof(*array);
    </pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4> Structs</h4>
<ul>
  <li> compound/derived type, like array but heterogeneous</li>
  <li> example
    <pre>
      struct student {
        char name[64];
        int age;
        float gpa;
        int grad_yr;
    };

   
    struct student student1;
    student1.age = 5;

    typedef struct student studentT;
    studentT student2;

    </pre>
  </li>
  <li> Structs are lvalues</li>
</ul>

<h4>Integers</h4>
<ul>
  <li> how many bytes in char, short, unsigned short, int, long?</li>
  <li> How do you find the largest short? smallest short?</li>
  <li> How do you find the largest int? smallest int?</li>
</ul>  

<h4>Processors</h4>

    <ul>
      <li> ALU</li>
      <li> registers: general purpose and specific</li>
      <li> MUXs</li>

    </ul>
